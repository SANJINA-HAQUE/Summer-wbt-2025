        <h2>Background</h2><hr>
        <p> 
                I’m a passionate and detail-oriented individual with a strong background in Computer Science and Engineering from AIUB.
                My interests lie in data analytics, where I enjoy exploring and uncovering meaningful insights from raw data.
                I have hands-on experience with SQL, Excel, C#, and C++, as well as creative skills in graphic design.
                I’m skilled at organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to support data-driven decision-making.
                Problem-solving is one of my core strengths, and I approach challenges with curiosity and persistence.
                I love working on real-world problems where data can create impact.
                Throughout my academic and project journey, I’ve developed both technical and analytical skills.
                I’m eager to contribute to innovative teams and continuously learn new tools and technologies.
                My goal is to grow as a data-driven professional and help organizations make smarter decisions.
