                        This project was developed as part of my Computer Graphics course at AIUB. 
                        I created an animated village scene using C++ with OpenGL (GLUT) in Code::Blocks.
                        The animation showcases a peaceful village environment with visual elements like 
                        the sun, moon, clouds, boats, trees, and houses etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I used graphical transformations such as translation, scaling, and rotation 
                        to bring movement to each element. Keyboard controls were added to toggle between 
                        day and night modes, making the scene interactive. This project helped me understand 
                        the core concepts of Computer Graphics.

                        This project was developed as part of my "Object-Oriented Programming 02" course at AIUB using C#. 
                        The goal was to design a desktop-based inventory management system for an IT company, allowing smooth tracking of hardware and software assets.
                        The system includes adding, updating, and deleting product records, viewing stock quantity and product categories, employee access control with login credentials,
                        real-time search and filtering functionality, organized interface using Windows Forms, database management and connectivity using MySQL Server etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout the development, I applied OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making the codebase modular and reusable.
                        This project gave me hands-on experience working with user interfaces, data validation in C#, 
                        and integrating an external MySQL database for persistent data storage and retrieval.

                        The Elevated Expressway Management System was developed to simulate and manage various operations of a city’s elevated expressway infrastructure. 
                        This project was created as part of my Advanced Database course at AIUB using C#, MySQL Server, and Oracle 10g XE.
                        The system was designed with a user-friendly interface and focused on organizing and managing data related to: Traffic Monitoring Unit, 
                        Tollbooth, Control Center, Vehicle, Maintenance Team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project strengthened my understanding of advanced database design, data normalization, entity-relationship modeling, 
                        and query handling between C# and external databases. It also helped me implement dual-database architecture (MySQL & Oracle) in a real-world simulation.

                        I designed and developed the official website for Ignite Branding, a creative advertising agency, using WordPress. 
                        The goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly site that reflects the company’s innovative identity

                        The card was designed to reflect their modern, bold, and creative identity. The project was designed using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, 
                        incorporated the client’s brand color palette and typography, delivered both print-ready and digital mockup formats. 
                        This project gave me hands-on experience in real-world client branding and visual identity, and sharpened my ability to work under design constraints and deadlines.
